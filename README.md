# Azure Monitoring Hackathon

## Overview

### This Azure Monitoring Hackathon is intended to teach you how to monitor you IaaS and PaaS workloads running on Azure.  During these three days you will be working Azure Monitor and Alerting, Log Analytics and Application Insights.

## Goals

### 1. Build technical skills on the monitoring tools in Azure. 

### 2. Review current application running and Azure and apply what was learned to come out with a monitoring plan.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Attendees have access to an Azure Subscription where they can each deploy the provided ARM template that will build a very detailed infrastructure to monitor.  This includes the Vnet, subnets, NSG(s), LB(s), VMs and a functional .NET application (eShopOnWeb).

### 2. Attendees should have a level 200-300 understanding of the Azure platform from an IaaS perspective.  
Understand concepts like ARM, resource groups, RBAC, network, storage, compute, virtual machines and security.  Previous experience working with ARM templates is recommended.

### 3. Access to a machine with Visual Studio Code and the Azure PowerShell Modules loaded.  VS Code ARM and PowerShell extensions should be configured.
